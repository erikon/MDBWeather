# MDBWeather
MDB Mini-Project 5

This weather application shows users current weather data at their location which is obtained through Google location services. In addition to the temperature and short description of the weather, it also tells the user if there is any forecasted rain in the near future and if so, around what time they can expect it to start. Using fragments, the application also displays weather data hour-by-hour for the next day as well as a day-by-day for the next week. Finally, users can search for a specific city to check its forcasted weather. This application was created with help from the DarkSky weather api.

The core concepts used in this application include the following:
- DarkSky API
- HTTP Requests to make calls to the API
- Fragments
- Geo Location Services
- JSON Objects

Screenshots Coming Soon
